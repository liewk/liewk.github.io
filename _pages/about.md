About Me
======

I am a cultural psychologist, and assistant professor at the Social Computing Laboratory at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. My research uses computational methods to examine social psychological topics, focusing on issues like cultural marginalisation, cultural differences in affect and emotion, and social media. 

I received my PhD in Cognitive and Behavioral Science from Kyoto University in 2021, as a research fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. My dissertation, on applying computational methods to cultural psychology, was awarded the Harry and Pola Triandis Dissertation Award by the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology in 2022. My research has been funded by [GoogleAI](https://research.google/outreach/research-scholar-program/recipients/), [SSRC](https://www.ssrc.org/grantees/abusive-language-and-gatekeeping-in-twitch-streaming-cultures/), and [JSPS](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html).
